# Deployment Guide (Deprecated)

> [!WARNING]
> **This guide is outdated.**
> Skywire has migrated to a high-performance **NoSQL (OpenSearch + Redis)** architecture and no longer supports standard PostgreSQL deployments on Fly.io/Render/Railway.

Please refer to the current documentation:

### [VPS Deployment Guide (Docker Compose)](VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md)

This is the only supported deployment method for the Firehose architecture.
